This example is to run a fit based on convolved PDFs. The test sample under the dataFiles directory contains reconstructed mass information and is from MC simulation.

For the executable "zachFit", it usually takes one number 0, 1, or 2 as its command-line argument. The speedup performance is somewhat of an disappointment for the moment compared to the pipipi0DPFit example.
